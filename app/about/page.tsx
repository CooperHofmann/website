      <p>
        Hi, I&apos;m Cooper Hofmann — a photographer based in the creative
        world of visual storytelling. Under the name{' '}
        <strong>Cooperofthecrop</strong>, I capture moments that blend natural
        light, bold composition, and authentic emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work spans portrait photography, urban landscapes, street
        photography, and commercial projects. I believe great photography is
        about connection — between the subject, the environment, and the viewer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it&apos;s a golden hour portrait session or an editorial shoot
        for a brand, I bring curiosity and craft to every frame.
